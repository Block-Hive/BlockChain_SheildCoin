# Blockchain Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The blockchain implementation follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is divided into several core components that work together to provide a complete blockchain solution.

## Core Components

### 1. Blockchain Core

The blockchain core consists of three main classes:

#### Block
- Represents a single block in the chain
- Contains transactions and metadata
- Implements proof-of-work mining
- Handles block validation

#### Blockchain
- Manages the chain of blocks
- Handles chain validation
- Manages mining operations
- Coordinates with transaction pool

#### Transaction
- Represents individual transactions
- Handles transaction signing and verification
- Manages transaction data structure

### 2. Transaction Pool

The transaction pool manages pending transactions:
- Maintains a queue of unconfirmed transactions
- Validates new transactions
- Provides transaction batching for mining
- Implements size limits and prioritization

### 3. Wallet System

The wallet system handles cryptographic operations:
- Generates and manages key pairs
- Signs transactions
- Verifies signatures
- Manages addresses

### 4. Database Layer

PostgreSQL database handles persistent storage:
- Stores blocks and transactions
- Manages wallet data
- Handles peer information
- Implements data integrity

### 5. API Layer

RESTful API provides external access:
- Exposes blockchain operations
- Handles wallet management
- Manages network operations
- Implements security measures

## Data Flow

### Transaction Creation Flow
1. User creates transaction through API
2. Transaction is signed with wallet
3. Transaction is added to pool
4. Transaction waits for mining

### Mining Flow
1. Miner requests to mine new block
2. System collects pending transactions
3. Block is created with proof-of-work
4. Block is added to chain
5. Transactions are removed from pool

### Network Synchronization Flow
1. Node receives new block
2. Block is validated
3. Chain is updated if valid
4. Transaction pool is updated

## Security Measures

### Cryptographic Security
- RSA for asymmetric encryption
- SHA-256 for hashing
- Digital signatures for transactions
- Secure key storage

### Network Security
- Peer validation
- Chain validation
- Transaction verification
- Rate limiting

### Data Security
- Encrypted storage
- Secure connections
- Input validation
- Error handling

## Database Schema

### Blocks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE blocks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    previous_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    nonce INTEGER NOT NULL,
    data JSONB NOT NULL
);
```

### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    block_id INTEGER REFERENCES blocks(id),
    sender VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    recipient VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    signature TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### Wallets Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE wallets (
    address VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    encrypted_private_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### Peers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE peers (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    port INTEGER NOT NULL,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

## Configuration

The system uses a hierarchical configuration approach:
1. Environment variables for sensitive data
2. Configuration file for system settings
3. Command-line arguments for runtime options

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation
- Transaction validation
- Block validation
- Network error handling
- Database error handling

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Transaction pool size limits
- Batch processing
- Connection pooling
- Caching mechanisms

### Scalability Features
- Modular design
- Stateless API
- Efficient data structures
- Optimized database queries

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes comprehensive monitoring:
- Transaction logging
- Block creation logging
- Network activity logging
- Error logging
- Performance metrics

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:
- Sharding support
- Smart contract integration
- Enhanced consensus mechanisms
- Improved network protocols
- Advanced mining algorithms
