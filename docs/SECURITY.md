# Security Documentation

This document provides an overview of the security features implemented in the BlockChain project, potential vulnerabilities to be aware of, and best practices for securing your deployment.

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Security

#### Wallet Security
- **RSA-3072 Key Pairs**: Wallet private keys are generated using RSA-3072, which provides strong cryptographic security (NIST recommended).
- **Private Key Encryption**: Private keys can be encrypted using AES-256 with a password, using PBKDF2 with a high iteration count (1,000,000) for key derivation.
- **Secure Storage**: Private keys are never stored in plain text in the database; only encrypted versions are persisted.
- **Key Separation**: Public and private keys are clearly separated in storage and transmission.

#### Transaction Security
- **Digital Signatures**: All transactions are signed using the sender's private key and can be verified using their public key.
- **Transaction Validation**: Comprehensive validation ensures transactions have valid amounts, addresses, and signatures.
- **Transaction Limits**: Minimum and maximum transaction amounts are enforced to prevent extreme values.
- **Double-Spend Prevention**: The blockchain structure inherently prevents double-spending.

#### Blockchain Integrity
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: All blocks are secured using SHA-256 cryptographic hashing.
- **SHA3-256 for Addresses**: Wallet addresses use SHA3-256 for added security.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Mining requires solving a cryptographic puzzle, making it computationally expensive to modify the blockchain.
- **Chain Validation**: The entire blockchain is validated when new blocks are added or when syncing from other nodes.
- **Previous Hash Linking**: Each block contains the hash of the previous block, creating a secure chain.

### Network Security

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limits to prevent DoS attacks.
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling prevents leaking sensitive information.
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing protection limits API access to specified hosts.

#### Peer-to-Peer Security
- **Trusted Peers**: Option to mark specific peers as trusted.
- **Connection Validation**: Peers are validated before being added to the routing table.
- **Message Authentication**: P2P messages are authenticated to prevent spoofing.
- **Network Partitioning Resistance**: The DHT implementation helps resist network partitioning attacks.

### Database Security

#### Database Protection
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterization to prevent SQL injection.
- **Connection Pooling**: Connection pooling with proper error handling prevents connection leaks.
- **Transaction Isolation**: Database operations use appropriate transaction isolation levels.
- **Failure Recovery**: The system can recover from database failures with minimal data loss.

#### Data Integrity
- **Database Constraints**: Database schema includes constraints to maintain data integrity.
- **Index Optimization**: Appropriate indexes improve performance and reduce attack surfaces.
- **Data Validation**: All data is validated before being stored in the database.
- **Transaction Hashing**: Transactions are hashed to ensure integrity during database operations.

## Potential Vulnerabilities

### Consensus Vulnerabilities

#### 51% Attack
- **Description**: If an attacker controls more than 50% of the network's mining power, they could potentially modify the blockchain.
- **Mitigation**: For production use, implement additional consensus mechanisms or trusted validator nodes.

#### Long-Range Attack
- **Description**: An attacker creates an alternative blockchain starting from genesis, potentially overtaking the main chain.
- **Mitigation**: Implement checkpointing or use a time-based weighting for chain selection.

#### Eclipse Attack
- **Description**: An attacker isolates a node from the honest network by surrounding it with malicious peers.
- **Mitigation**: Implement connection diversity requirements and trusted peer lists.

### Network Vulnerabilities

#### Sybil Attack
- **Description**: An attacker creates multiple identities to gain disproportionate influence.
- **Mitigation**: Implement reputation systems or require proof-of-work for node registration.

#### DDoS Attack
- **Description**: Distributed Denial of Service attacks could make nodes unavailable.
- **Mitigation**: Use proper rate limiting, IP filtering, and cloud-based DDoS protection.

#### Man-in-the-Middle
- **Description**: An attacker intercepts communication between nodes.
- **Mitigation**: Implement TLS/SSL for all communications and use certificate pinning.

### API Vulnerabilities

#### Unauthorized Access
- **Description**: The API lacks built-in authentication, allowing anyone to access it.
- **Mitigation**: Implement API key authentication, JWT tokens, or OAuth for production use.

#### Rate Limit Bypass
- **Description**: Attackers may use distributed requests to bypass rate limits.
- **Mitigation**: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting based on multiple factors.

#### Transaction Spam
- **Description**: An attacker floods the network with valid but useless transactions.
- **Mitigation**: Implement transaction fees and prioritization mechanisms.

### Wallet Vulnerabilities

#### Private Key Theft
- **Description**: If private keys are compromised, all funds can be stolen.
- **Mitigation**: Always use encrypted wallets, hardware security modules for high-value wallets, and follow secure key management practices.

#### Weak Passwords
- **Description**: Weak passwords could allow brute-force attacks on encrypted private keys.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce strong password policies and implement account lockouts.

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

#### Network Security

   - Restrict access to API port (default: 5000) to trusted IP addresses.
   - Allow DHT port (default: 6000) only from known peer IP addresses if possible.
   - Block all unnecessary ports and services.

2. **TLS/SSL Implementation**:
   - Always use HTTPS for API endpoints in production.
   - Configure proper certificate validation and renewal.
   - Use strong cipher suites and disable outdated protocols.

3. **Reverse Proxy**:
   - Place the blockchain API behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.
   - Implement additional security headers and request filtering.
   - Configure proper logging and monitoring.

#### Server Hardening
1. **Operating System Hardening**:
   - Keep OS and packages updated with security patches.
   - Implement principle of least privilege for all services.
   - Disable unnecessary services and remove unused software.

2. **Application Isolation**:
   - Run the blockchain node in a container or virtual machine.
   - Implement proper resource limits to prevent DoS.
   - Use separate user accounts with minimal privileges.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging for all security events.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities like multiple failed API requests.
   - Monitor system resources to detect potential DoS attacks.

### Key Management

### Production Customizations

#### Authentication Implementation
1. **API Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for API access.
   - Example code for JWT middleware:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
     import jwt
     from functools import wraps
     
     app = Flask(__name__)
     app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'  # Store securely
     
     def token_required(f):
         @wraps(f)
         def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
             token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
             if not token:
                 return jsonify({'error': 'Token is missing'}), 401
             try:
                 jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'])
             except:
                 return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid token'}), 401
             return f(*args, **kwargs)
         return decorated
     
     # Then use the decorator on your endpoints
     @app.route('/secure-endpoint')
     @token_required
     def secure_endpoint():
         return jsonify({'data': 'This is protected data'})
     ```

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Implement roles for different API capabilities (admin, miner, user).
   - Restrict sensitive operations to appropriate roles.

3. **API Keys for Services**:
   - Issue API keys for service integrations.
   - Implement key rotation and revocation procedures.

#### Additional Security Layers
1. **Transaction Approval Workflows**:
   - For high-value transactions, implement multi-signature requirements.
   - Create approval workflows for transactions above certain thresholds.

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Implement transaction monitoring for unusual patterns.
   - Create alerts for suspicious activities like unusual mining patterns.

3. **Security Headers**:
   - Add security headers to API responses:
     ```python
     @app.after_request
     def add_security_headers(response):
         response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
         response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
         response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
         response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
         return response
     ```
